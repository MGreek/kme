## Requirements
* Develop a web-app for editing sheet music
* The app should allow imports/exports of files specific to it
* The app should allow great customization of keyboard shortcuts
* The app should let the user write nonsense, so it shouldn't check for example whether the notes in a measure add up to the measures length (this is similar to how text editors let you write nonsense)
* Export formats should include PDF
* Importing should only work with the specific format for the program
